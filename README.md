# ESP32-cam http-server streaming

This repo is based in the HTTP-Server example in tho the esp-idf, and in the streaming example of the esp32-cam repository.

* Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`) to configure Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
* For esp32-camera enable the support for external SPRAM.

* In order to test the HTTPD server persistent sockets demo:
    1. compile and burn the firmware `idf.py -p PORT flash`
    2. run `idf.py -p PORT monitor` and note down the IP assigned to your ESP module. The default port is 80
    3. test the example :
        * run the test script : "python scripts/client.py \<IP\> \<port\> \<MSG\>"
            * the provided test script first does a GET \hello and displays the response
            * the script does a POST to \echo with the user input \<MSG\> and displays the response
        * or use curl (asssuming IP is 192.168.43.130):
            1. "curl 192.168.43.130:80/hello"  - tests the GET "\hello" handler
            2. "curl -X POST --data-binary @anyfile 192.168.43.130:80/echo > tmpfile"
                * "anyfile" is the file being sent as request body and "tmpfile" is where the body of the response is saved
                * since the server echoes back the request body, the two files should be same, as can be confirmed using : "cmp anyfile tmpfile"
            3. "curl -X PUT -d "0" 192.168.43.130:80/ctrl" - disable /hello and /echo handlers
            4. "curl -X PUT -d "1" 192.168.43.130:80/ctrl" -  enable /hello and /echo handlers
            
* If the server log shows "httpd_parse: parse_block: request URI/header too long", especially when handling POST requests, then you probably need to increase HTTPD_MAX_REQ_HDR_LEN, which you can find in the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`): Component config -> HTTP Server -> Max HTTP Request Header Length

* Access to the camera streaming in the /cam url.
